        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>This application predicts COVID-19 <br> from chest X-rays.
            Use the upload button to <br> upload an image of an X-ray and use
            the <br> predict button to get a prediction. The app will <br> tell you
            how likely the person has COVID-19 <br> based on the X-ray.
            The app can only use PNG <br> images. If you upload a JEPG image
            or any <br> other type of image it will not work. </p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>The app can detect COVID-19 in 88% of cases <br> where the disease is present. </p>
    </div>
